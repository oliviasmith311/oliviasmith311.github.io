            <h3>My Bio</h3>
            <p>Hi! My name is Olivia Smith. I’m a Columbus native who loves
                my family, music, theatre, and laughing.
                I’m the mother of two spooky black cats,
                Darla and Little (who is not actually little
                at all and needs to go on a diet).
                In my free time, I enjoy cross stitching,
                collecting vinyl albums, and performing
                standup comedy. I have always had an interest
                in tech, which I started to pursue when I
                joined We Can Code IT in January of 2020.
                My goals are to create as many cool things
                as possible, make people laugh, and leave
                the world a little bit better than I found it.</p>

            <h3>Virtual Aliens</h3>
            <p>In this project, I worked on a team to create a game
                application where the user could create virtual aliens
                to keep in an alien shelter. Users had to perform
                tasks to make sure the aliens had money, were well-fed,
                and were intelligent.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>High St. Hospital</h3>
            <p>High St. Hospital: In this project, I worked
                independently to create an application that
                inventoried the staff and patients of the imaginary
                High St. Hospital. The user was able to perform
                tasks on patients to affect their levels of health and blood.</p>
