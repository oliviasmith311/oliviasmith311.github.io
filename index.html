                <p>Hi! My name is Olivia Smith. I’m a Columbus native who loves
                    my family, music, theatre, and laughing.
                    I’m the mother of two spooky black cats,
                    Darla and Little (who is not actually little
                    at all and needs to go on a diet).
                    In my free time, I enjoy cross stitching,
                    collecting vinyl albums, and performing
                    standup comedy. I have always had an interest
                    in tech, which I started to pursue when I
                    joined We Can Code IT in January of 2020.
                    My goals are to create as many cool things
                    as possible, make people laugh, and leave
                    the world a little bit better than I found it.</p>
