            <p class="projects__paragraph">In this project, I worked in a
                four-person team to create an application called
                "Virtual Alien Shelter." In this application, users
                could add aliens to an alien shelter, and then could
                take action on the aliens to keep them smart, well-fed,
                and financially secure. Users could feed their aliens,
                make them read, and make them go to work. This project
                utilized mulitple classes and interfaces, providing two
                types of alien, Cyborg and Organic, and two races of alien,
                Neptunian or Plutonian. The game had a "tick" method, where
                every move the user took made the hunger, intelligence and
                finance levels go down, so that the user had to take action
                to keep these from reaching a critical level.</p>
            <p>Skills used: Java, OOP, TDD, Agile (Scrum), Source Control / Git</p>
