            <p>In this project, I worked
                independently to create an application that told
                the story of the imaginary High St. Hospital.
                The application added staff and patients to the
                hospital, and gave information about each person.
                The doctors had stats such as salary, job title,
                and ID number. The patients had a health level
                and a blood level. An added game element gave
                users the ability to have either a doctor or nurse
                perform an action on a patient, to treat them or
                draw their blood, which affected the patients'
                health and blood levels.</p>
